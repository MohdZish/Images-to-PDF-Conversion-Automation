# Images-to-PDF-Conversion-Automation

This is a small but a cool project I worked on, with the goal here being to automate the boring mundane task of organizing multiple image files in a PDF document.
Instead of using word or other existing softwares for these stuff, this Python code is capable of producing a PDF document with all the images.

The pattern for embedding the images in the pdf can be chosen by the user (or the programmer), and the images can hence be thoroughly distributed according to out liking.
This is hence a great tool for printing.

This was made using Python's FPDF library, and also glob.
